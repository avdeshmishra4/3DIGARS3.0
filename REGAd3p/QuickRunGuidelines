REGAd3p
==========
REGAd3p is a predictor of absolute accessible surface area of residues 
in protein. The predictor is  based on regularized exact regression 
method using 3rd order polynomial as kernel and  with genetic algorithm 
optimization of weights. It takes protein sequence (standard FASTA format) 
as input and outputs per residue predicted ASA values. This software 
also predicts secondary structure internally to use the probabilities
of three types of secondary structure (helix, coil and beta). We also 
report the result of secondary structure prediction.

Quick Run Guide
===============

1) SET input
	- Redirect into REGAd3p/Software/Input
	- Follow the instructions in "ReadMe_Input.txt" to complete "id_list.txt"
	
2) SET path variables within script 'run_REGAd3p'
	- Redirect into REGAd3p/Software/Scripts
	- SET path of PSI-BLAST (BLAST/bin) and NR database
	- SET path of IUPred source codes (given within the software in AdditionalFiles directory)
	- SET path of libSVM installation directory 
	
3) Run prediction
	- Redirect into REGAd3p/Software/Scripts	
	- Execute 'run_REGAd3p'
		- ./run_REGAd3p (SET the permission if required)
	- Prediction outputs of secondary structure will be at "Output/prediction/$id/SS"
		- 'id.SSp'
	- Prediction outputs of ASA will be at "Output/prediction/$id/ASA"
		- 'id.ASAp'		
For detail description of Software, users are requested to read 'ReadMe' in 'REGAd3p' package.
		
Thanks!!
ENJOY!!
